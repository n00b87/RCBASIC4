#header function  ComputeActorAngularImpulseDenominator( actor,   x,   y,   z)

Computes a scalar value that represents how an actor will respond to an angular impulse at a given point, taking into account the actor's inertia tensor (which governs how the object resists rotation). This function is particularly useful in calculating the actor's rotational response to an impulse, typically during collision resolution or constraints involving rotation.
