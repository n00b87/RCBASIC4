Computes the gyroscopic impulse for an actor in an implicit manner, based on the actor's current angular velocity and inertia. This function is used to simulate the gyroscopic effect—also known as gyroscopic precession—which occurs when a rotating object experiences a torque that causes its axis of rotation to change.
