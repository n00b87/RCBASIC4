Computes the gyroscopic impulse for an actor in an implicit manner, but in this case, it performs the calculation relative to the world frame of reference, rather than the actorâ€™s local frame. This function is used to handle the gyroscopic effects (i.e., gyroscopic precession) of a rotating object when a torque is applied, affecting its axis of rotation.
