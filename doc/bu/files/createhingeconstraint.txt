#title createHingeConstraint [RCBasic Doc]
#header function  createHingeConstraint( actorA, frameA, useReferenceFrameA )

Simulates a hinge joint, which allows two actors (or an actor and the world) to rotate around a single axis while restricting movement along the other axes. This is similar to the way a door swings on its hinges or how an elbow joint functions in the human body.

#code
actorA = CreateCubeActor(100) 'Creates a cube actor
frameA = DimMatrix(4, 4) 'A transform matrix must be a 4x4 matrix
SetIdentityMatrix(frameA, 4) 'Sets frameB to a 4x4 identity matrix
SetMatrixTranslation(frameA, 0, 1, 0) 'Sets the attach point of the constraint to the top of the cube
hinge = CreateHingeConstraint(actorA, frameA, true)
#/code

Note: It is recommended to use CreateSlideConstraintEx() in most cases
