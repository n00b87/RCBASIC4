#title GetLinePlaneIntersection [RCBasic Doc]
#header function GetLinePlaneIntersection(ByRef line_point, ByRef line_direction, ByRef plane_point_1, ByRef plane_point_2, ByRef plane_point_3, ByRef intersection)

This function calculates the intersection between a line and a plane in 3D space and stores the result in intersection

Parameters:
#list ul
#li line_point - An array with an (x,y,z) point representing the start of a line
#li line_direction - An array with an (x,y,z) point representing another point on the line in the direction its moving
#li plane_point_1 - An array with an (x,y,z) point representing a point on a plane in 3D space
#li plane_point_2 - An array with an (x,y,z) point representing a point on a plane in 3D space
#li plane_point_3 - An array with an (x,y,z) point representing a point on a plane in 3D space 
#/list

Returns true if intersection point is on the plane
