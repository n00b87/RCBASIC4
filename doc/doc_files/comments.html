		<p><h2>COMMENTS </h2></p>
		<p>
		 Comments are remarks you can add to your code which will be ignored by the compiler.  To make a comment you would use a single quote.  Look at the following: 
		</p>
		<p id="rc_code"><code>
			<span class="rc_comment">' THIS IS A COMMENT </span><br>
			<span class="rc_keyword">Print</span>&nbsp;HELLO&nbsp;<span class="rc_string">"WORLD      ' THIS IS ANOTHER COMMENT <br>
		</code></p>
		<p>
		 MULTI-LINE COMMENTS 
		</p>
		<p>
		 Multi-line comments are comments that can span multiple lines.  To start a multi-line comment you would use forward slash followed by a single quote and you would end it with a single quote followed by a forward slash.  Look at the following: 
		</p>
		<p id="rc_code"><code>
			/<span class="rc_comment">' THIS IS </span><br>
			A&nbsp;<br>
			MULTI-LINE&nbsp;COMMENT&nbsp;<span class="rc_comment">'/ </span><br>
		</code></p>
