		<p><h1>SCOPE </h1></p>
		<p>
		 Scope refers to where you are able to access a variable.  Basically variables cannot be accessed from outside the scope they are created in.  Look at the following: 
		</p>
		<p id="rc_code"><code>
			A&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span class="rc_number">5</span>&nbsp;<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
			<span class="rc_keyword">While</span>&nbsp;A&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<span class="rc_number">10</span>&nbsp;<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span class="rc_number">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="rc_comment">'-----  B is created inside this loop and cannot be accessed outside of this loop </span><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;=&nbsp;A&nbsp;+&nbsp;<span class="rc_number">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="rc_comment">'----- A was created before this loop started so it will be able to be used after this loop ends </span><br>
			<span class="rc_keyword">Wend</span>&nbsp;<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
			<span class="rc_keyword">Print</span>&nbsp;B&nbsp;<br>
		</code></p>
		<p>
		 The above program WILL NOT COMPILE. That is because the variable B was created inside the scope of the WHILE loop and nothing outside the WHILE loop will be able to access it.  The variable A was created outside the WHILE loop so the variable A could be used anywhere in this example.  So a variable can go into a deeper scope than where it was created but it cannot go to a lesser scope than where it was created.  A scope deepens every time a new block is started.  Blocks refer to the code within a loop, within a Function, or within a Sub Routine.
