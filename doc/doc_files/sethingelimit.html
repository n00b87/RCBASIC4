		<p><h2>sub  setHingeLimit( constraint_id,  low,  high,  softness,  bias_factor,  relaxation_factor) </h2></p>
		<p>
		 Defines the angular limits of the hinge's rotation. A hinge constraint allows two actors (or one actor and the world) to rotate around a single axis, similar to a door hinge. This function restricts how far this rotation can go by setting minimum and maximum angles. 
		</p>
		<p>
		 By default, if no limits are applied, the hinge can rotate freely around the axis. 
		</p>
		<ul>
		<li>
		low: This is the minimum angular limit. It defines the smallest angle that the hinge can rotate to in the negative direction. 
		</li>
		<li>
		high: This is the maximum angular limit. It defines the largest angle that the hinge can rotate to in the positive direction. 
		</li>
		<li>
		softness: Controls how "soft" the limit is. A value closer to 0 results in a hard limit (instant stop when the limit is reached), while a value closer to 1 allows some "give" before the limit fully takes effect, making the motion smoother as the limit is approached. 
		</li>
		<li>
		bias_factor: Helps to correct drift or penetration by applying a correction bias when the hinge reaches the limit. A higher value will apply a stronger bias to correct errors in the position. 
		</li>
		<li>
		relaxation_factor: Controls how the hinge behaves once the limit is reached. A value closer to 1 results in faster relaxation after hitting the limit, while a lower value makes the motion more rigid. 
		</li>
		</ul>
