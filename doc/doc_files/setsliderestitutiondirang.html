		 Sets the restitution value for angular motion. The restitution coefficient is a measure of how much energy is conserved in a collision or constraint interaction, specifically for angular movements. 
		</p>
		<p>
		 When actors collide or interact, their angular momentum and position can change, and the restitution value governs how much of that energy is retained after the interaction.
