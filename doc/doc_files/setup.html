		<p><h2><b><u>SETTING UP RCBASIC</u></b> </h2></p>
		<p>
		 RCBasic comes with 2 command-line tools for creating programs. The first is rcbasic_build which takes your sourcecode in your *.bas file and compiles it into a *.cbc file. The *.cbc file contains intermediate bytecode which can be ran with the rcbasic (rcbasic.exe on windows) application. 
		</p>
		<p>
		 NOTE: On Windows, you need to include all the 32-bit dlls with the 32-bit executable and all the 64-bit dlls with the 64-bit executable. The rcbasic package tool will automatically do all of this for you as well as package for other systems as well. 
		</p>
		<p>
		 <h2><b><u>RUN PROGRAMS FROM GEANY</u></b></h2> 
		</p>
		<p>
		 <b><u>LINUX</u></b> In the installer directory there is a folder called geany_files. Inside the folder there is a file named filetypes.rcbasic. You can override the geany *.bas configuration by replacing the freeBasic configuration with this file. Just copy this file to the geany filedefs path, which on most linux distibutions should be (/home/.config/geany/filedefs), and rename the file to filetypes.freebasic. 
		</p>
		<p>
		 Once you have rcbasic set up with geany you just need to create a new file and save it as *.bas. Then you can compile your program by going to Build->Compile. Once your program is compiled you can run it by going to Build->Execute. 
		</p>
		<p>
		 NOTE: If you want to use a different file extension for rcbasic programs you can still use this file and just set it up for a different extension. Refer to the geany documentation on how to set up different file types. 
		</p>
		<p>
		 <b><u>WINDOWS</u></b> Geany comes preconfigured with rcbasic on windows. Just run the start_editor.bat file and create a new *.bas file. Select the File->New with Template option in the menu to start with a simple template program. Once you have created a new *.bas file goto Build->Compile to compile your program to a *.cbc file. Then goto Build->Execute to run your program. 
		</p>
		<p>
		 <h2><b><u>USING RCBASIC FROM THE COMMAND-LINE</u></b></h2> RCBasic will be added to path on install on linux. On Windows you will need to add the rcbasic folder to your path. Either (rcbasic/rcbasic_32) or (rcbasic/rcbasic_64) depending on your operating system. Once rcbasic is in your path you can simple pass a source file to rcbasic_build to create a *.cbc file. 
		</p>
		<p id="rc_code"><code>
			rcbasic_build&nbsp;myprogram.bas&nbsp;<br>
		</code></p>
		<p>
		 Once you have a *.cbc file you can pass it to rcbasic to run it. 
		</p>
		<p id="rc_code"><code>
			rcbasic&nbsp;myprogram.cbc&nbsp;<br>
		</code></p>
		<p>
		 Both tools also except the --version argument which will simply output the version of rcbasic you are using. 
		</p>
		<p id="rc_code"><code>
			rcbasic_build&nbsp;--version&nbsp;<br>
			rcbasic&nbsp;-version&nbsp;<br>
		</code></p>
		<p>
		 <h2><b><u>PORTING TO OTHER PLATFORMS</u></b></h2> 
		</p>
		<p>
		 From RCBasic Studio, select tools->distribute and then select the platforms you want to distribute to and click the "MAKE APP" button.
