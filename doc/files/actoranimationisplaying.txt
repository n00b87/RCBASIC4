#title ActorAnimationIsPlaying [RCBasic Doc]
#header function ActorAnimationIsPlaying(actor)

Returns true if an actor is currently playing an animation

Note: If the number of loops in the animation is set to -1 then this will always be true since it does not return false until it plays the last frame in the last loop
