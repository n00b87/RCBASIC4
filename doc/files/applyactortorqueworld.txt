#title ApplyActorTorqueWorld [RCBasic Doc]
#header Sub ApplyActorTorqueWorld( actor,   x,   y,   z)

Applies a continuous torque to an actor, causing it to accelerate its rotational motion over time. Unlike applyActorTorqueImpulse, which causes an immediate change in angular velocity, this applies a torque force gradually, leading to a continuous rotational effect, similar to applying a force to linear motion.
