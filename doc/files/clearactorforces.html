		<p><h2>sub clearActorForces( actor) </h2></p>
		<p>
		 Resets or clears all the forces and torques that have been applied to a rigid body in the current simulation step. This ensures that any forces, including linear forces and torques, do not accumulate from one simulation step to the next. 
		</p>
		<p>
		 <b>Notes:</b> 
		</p>
		<ul>
		<li>
		<b>Resets Forces:</b> It removes all linear forces (like those applied by applyActorForce or applyActorCentralForce) and torques (like those applied by applyActorTorque). 
		</li>
		<li>
		<b>Does Not Affect Velocity:</b> It clears only the applied forces and torques, but the current velocity (linear and angular) of the actor remains unchanged. 
		</li>
		<li>
		<b>Typically Used in Each Simulation Step:</b> Used to reset forces after each step, so that only new forces applied in the next step will affect the body. 
		</li>
		</ul>
