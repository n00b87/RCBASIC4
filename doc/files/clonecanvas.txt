#title CloneCanvas [RCBasic Doc]
#header function CloneCanvas(c_num, mode)

Returns a clone of a canvas. Clone canvases are mirrors of the original canvas so when you draw to one it will also be on the other. This is useful for a splitscreen 2d game.

Mode is a canvas render mode like the one passed to OpenCanvas()
