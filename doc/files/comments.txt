#header COMMENTS

Comments are remarks you can add to your code which will be ignored by the compiler.  To make a comment you would use a single quote.  Look at the following:
#code
' THIS IS A COMMENT
Print HELLO WORLD"      ' THIS IS ANOTHER COMMENT
#/code

MULTI-LINE COMMENTS

Multi-line comments are comments that can span multiple lines.  To start a multi-line comment you would use forward slash followed by a single quote and you would end it with a single quote followed by a forward slash.  Look at the following:
#code
/' THIS IS
A
MULTI-LINE COMMENT '/
#/code
