#header CONSTANTS

RCBasic has a special type of variable called a constant which can hold an expression.  This means it can hold an expression and not determine its value until its used.  For example you can have a constant called C that is equal to A + B.  Everytime you change the value of A or B, C's value will also change.   Because constants hold expressions, any valid expression in RCBasic can be stored in a constant.
#code
const  A = 5
const  MY_PRINT = print "hello world"
