		<p>
		 Creates a Gear Joint 
		</p>
		<p>
		 A gear joint is used to connect two joints together. Either joint can be a revolute or prismatic joint. You specify a gear ratio to bind the motions together: coordinate1 + ratio * coordinate2 = constant The ratio can be negative or positive. If one joint is a revolute joint and the other joint is a prismatic joint, then the ratio will have units of length or units of 1/length.
