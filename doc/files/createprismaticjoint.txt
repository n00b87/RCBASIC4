Creates a Prismatic Joint

A prismatic joint. This joint provides one degree of freedom: translation along an axis fixed in bodyA. Relative rotation is prevented. You can use a joint limit to restrict the range of motion and a joint motor to drive the motion or to model joint friction. 

Parameters

#li spriteA - first body
#li spriteB - second body
#li aX, aY - anchor point
#li axisX, axisY - Used to define a linear direction from anchor point
