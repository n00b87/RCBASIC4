#title CreateSprite [RCBasic Doc]
#header function CreateSprite( img )

This function returns a new sprite which you can place in a variable for use in your program.

Here is an example of opening a sprite canvas layer, creating a sprite, setting it's position and finally displaying it.

#code
    isFullScreen = false
    vSync = true
    winWidth = 640
    winHeight = 480
    canViewPortX = 0
    canViewPortY = 0

    OpenWindow("CreateSprite", winWidth, winHeight, isFullScreen, vSync)
    sCanvas = OpenCanvasSpriteLayer(canViewPortX, canViewPortY, winWidth, winHeight)
    Canvas(sCanvas)

    DIM eye
    DIM eyeW
    DIM eyeH

    eye = LoadImage("theEye.png")
    GetImageSize(eye, eyeW, eyeH)

    eyeSprite = CreateSprite(eye, eyeW, eyeH)
    SetSpritePosition(eyeSprite, 100, 100)

    While Not Key(K_ESCAPE)
        'ClearCanvas() For a sprite layer canvas, you don't need to call ClearCanvas.  It's automatically called.
        Update()      'Update automatically deals with drawing the sprites on the sprite canvas.
