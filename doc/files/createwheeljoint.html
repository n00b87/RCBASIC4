		 Creates a wheel joint. 
		</p>
		<p>
		 A wheel joint. This joint provides two degrees of freedom: translation along an axis fixed in bodyA and rotation in the plane. In other words, it is a point to line constraint with a rotational motor and a linear spring/damper. The spring/damper is initialized upon creation. This joint is designed for vehicle suspensions.
