#title getConeLimit [RCBasic Doc]
#header function  getConeLimit( constraint_id,  limit_index)

Returns the angular limit associated with a specific degree of freedom in the cone constraint. This limit defines the range of motion allowed around a given axis (twist, swing1, or swing2) for the constrained actors.

limitIndex is an integer that indicates which limit to retrieve. It typically takes values corresponding to the type of limit:
#list ul
#li 0: Limit for the twist axis.
#li 1: Limit for the swing1 axis.
#li 2: Limit for the swing2 axis.
#/list

Returns value is the maximum angle or range allowed for the specified degree of freedom (twist, swing1, or swing2)
