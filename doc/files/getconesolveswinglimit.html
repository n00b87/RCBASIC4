		<p><h2>function  getConeSolveSwingLimit( constraint_id) </h2></p>
		<p>
		 Returns whether the swing limit of the constraint is currently being enforced during the simulation. 
		</p>
		<p>
		 The swing limit defines the boundary within which the connected actors can swing. When the bodies approach or exceed this limit, the physics engine enforces a constraint to prevent further motion. If the swing limit is exceeded during simulation, corrective forces are applied to bring the actors back within the allowed range.
