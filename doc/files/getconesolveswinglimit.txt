#title getConeSolveSwingLimit [RCBasic Doc]
#header function  getConeSolveSwingLimit( constraint_id)

Returns whether the swing limit of the constraint is currently being enforced during the simulation.

The swing limit defines the boundary within which the connected actors can swing. When the bodies approach or exceed this limit, the physics engine enforces a constraint to prevent further motion.
If the swing limit is exceeded during simulation, corrective forces are applied to bring the actors back within the allowed range.
