#header function  getConeSolveTwistLimit( constraint_id)

Returns whether the twist limit is currently being enforced during the simulation.

The twist limit controls how much the connected actors can rotate around the central axis of the joint (the "twist" axis).
When the actors rotate beyond this allowed limit, the physics engine applies corrective forces to keep the rotation within the defined twist range.
