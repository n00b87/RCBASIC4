		<p><h2>function  getConstraintAppliedImpulse( constraint_id) </h2></p>
		<p>
		 Returns the impulse applied to a constraint during the last simulation step. This impulse is the force integrated over a small time step (impulse = force Ã— time) and is applied to resolve the constraint and maintain its behavior, such as keeping two objects connected or restricting movement.
