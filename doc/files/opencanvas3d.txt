#header function OpenCanvas3D( viewport_x, viewport_y, viewport_w, viewport_h, mode)

Returns a 3D Canvas for viewing the scene.

Returns -1 if canvas could not be created.

Note: Each 3D canvas has its own camera so you need to make sure you have the canvas active before doing anything with the camera

Note: 2D drawing commands do not work on 3D canvases. You need to open a 2D canvas for drawing images.
