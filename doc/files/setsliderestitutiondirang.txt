Sets the restitution value for angular motion. The restitution coefficient is a measure of how much energy is conserved in a collision or constraint interaction, specifically for angular movements.

When actors collide or interact, their angular momentum and position can change, and the restitution value governs how much of that energy is retained after the interaction.
