Sets the restitution value for orthogonal linear motion. This value determines how much energy is conserved (or how "bouncy" the interaction is) when linear motion occurs in a direction orthogonal (perpendicular) to the primary sliding axis of the constraint.

Orthogonal Linear Motion: In the context of a slider constraint, orthogonal linear motion refers to translational movement along axes that are perpendicular to the main sliding axis of the constraint.

Restitution: Restitution is a measure of how much energy is retained or conserved during a collision or interaction. A restitution value of 0.0 indicates no bounce (perfectly inelastic), while 1.0 indicates maximum bounce (perfectly elastic). For orthogonal linear motion, this value describes how much the actors bounce or retain energy when they hit limits or experience movement perpendicular to the sliderâ€™s main axis.
