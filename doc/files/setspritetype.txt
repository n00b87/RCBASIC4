#title SetSpriteType [RCBasic Doc]
#header Sub SetSpriteType(sprite, sprite_type)

Sets the type of collision body a sprite has

#list ul
#li SPRITE_TYPE_STATIC
#li SPRITE_TYPE_KINEMATIC
#li SPRITE_TYPE_DYNAMIC
#/list

Here is an example of SPRITE_TYPE_DYNAMIC:

#code
'This is showing SPRITE_TYPE_DYNAMIC

isFullScreen = false
vSync = true
winWidth = 640
winHeight = 480
canViewPortX = 0
canViewPortY = 0

OpenWindow("SetSpriteType_Dynamic", winWidth, winHeight, isFullScreen, vSync)
sCanvas = OpenCanvasSpriteLayer(canViewPortX, canViewPortY, winWidth, winHeight)
Canvas(sCanvas)

DIM eye
DIM eyeW
DIM eyeH
eyeSpriteX = 100
eyeSpriteY = 100
eyeSprite2X = 400
eyeSprite2Y = 125

eye = LoadImage("theEye.png")
GetImageSize(eye, eyeW, eyeH)

eyeSprite = CreateSprite(eye, eyeW, eyeH)
SetSpritePosition(eyeSprite, eyeSpriteX, eyeSpriteY)
SetSpriteSolid(eyeSprite, 1)

'When Sprites are created and physics activated there "type" is Dyanmic by default
'The sprites have collision and physics activated, so they can move and react to other bodies.

eyeSprite2 = CreateSprite(eye, eyeW, eyeH)
SetSpritePosition(eyeSprite2, eyeSprite2X, eyeSprite2Y)
SetSpriteSolid(eyeSprite2, 1)

While Not Key(K_ESCAPE)

	SetSpriteLinearVelocity(eyeSprite, 80, 0)

	Update()

Here is an example of SPRITE_TYPE_STATIC:

#code
'This is showing SPRITE_TYPE_STATIC

isFullScreen = false
vSync = true
winWidth = 640
winHeight = 480
canViewPortX = 0
canViewPortY = 0

OpenWindow("SetSpriteType_Static", winWidth, winHeight, isFullScreen, vSync)
sCanvas = OpenCanvasSpriteLayer(canViewPortX, canViewPortY, winWidth, winHeight)
Canvas(sCanvas)

DIM eye
DIM eyeW
DIM eyeH
eyeSpriteX = 100
eyeSpriteY = 100
eyeSprite2X = 400
eyeSprite2Y = 125

eye = LoadImage("theEye.png")
GetImageSize(eye, eyeW, eyeH)

eyeSprite = CreateSprite(eye, eyeW, eyeH)
SetSpritePosition(eyeSprite, eyeSpriteX, eyeSpriteY)
SetSpriteSolid(eyeSprite, 1)

'When Sprites are created and physics activated there "type" is Dyanmic by default
'The sprites have collision and physics activated, so they can move and react to other bodies.

eyeSprite2 = CreateSprite(eye, eyeW, eyeH)
SetSpritePosition(eyeSprite2, eyeSprite2X, eyeSprite2Y)
SetSpriteSolid(eyeSprite2, 1)
SetSpriteType(eyeSprite2, SPRITE_TYPE_STATIC)					'When a sprite is made solid nothing can move it

While Not Key(K_ESCAPE)

	SetSpriteLinearVelocity(eyeSprite, 80, 0)

Finally here is an example of SPRITE_TYPE_KINEMATIC:

#code
'This is showing SPRITE_TYPE_KINEMATIC

isFullScreen = false
vSync = true
winWidth = 640
winHeight = 480
canViewPortX = 0
canViewPortY = 0

OpenWindow("SetSpriteType_Kinematic", winWidth, winHeight, isFullScreen, vSync)
sCanvas = OpenCanvasSpriteLayer(canViewPortX, canViewPortY, winWidth, winHeight)
Canvas(sCanvas)

DIM eye
DIM eyeW
DIM eyeH
eyeSpriteX = 100
eyeSpriteY = 100
eyeSprite2X = 400
eyeSprite2Y = 125

eye = LoadImage("theEye.png")
GetImageSize(eye, eyeW, eyeH)

eyeSprite = CreateSprite(eye, eyeW, eyeH)
SetSpritePosition(eyeSprite, eyeSpriteX, eyeSpriteY)
SetSpriteSolid(eyeSprite, 1)
SetSpriteType(eyeSprite, SPRITE_TYPE_KINEMATIC)			'KINEMATIC type makes the sprite able to be moved, but it does not react to dynamic bodies.

eyeSprite2 = CreateSprite(eye, eyeW, eyeH)
SetSpritePosition(eyeSprite2, eyeSprite2X, eyeSprite2Y)
SetSpriteSolid(eyeSprite2, 1)

While Not Key(K_ESCAPE)

	SetSpriteLinearVelocity(eyeSprite, 80, 0)

	Update()
