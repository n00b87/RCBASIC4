#title RCBasic Setup [RCBasic Doc]

<h1><b><u>SETTING UP RCBASIC</u></b></h1>

RCBasic comes with 2 command-line tools for creating programs. The first is rcbasic_build which takes your sourcecode in your *.bas file and compiles it into a *.cbc file. The *.cbc file contains intermediate bytecode which can be ran with the rcbasic (rcbasic.exe on windows) application.

NOTE: On Windows, you need to include all the 32-bit dlls with the 32-bit executable and all the 64-bit dlls with the 64-bit executable. The rcbasic package tool will automatically do all of this for you as well as package for other systems as well.

<h1><b><u>RUN PROGRAMS FROM GEANY</u></b></h1>

<b><u>LINUX</u></b>
In the installer directory there is a folder called geany_files. Inside the folder there is a file named filetypes.rcbasic. You can override the geany *.bas configuration by replacing the freeBasic configuration with this file. Just copy this file to the geany filedefs path, which on most linux distibutions should be (/home/.config/geany/filedefs), and rename the file to filetypes.freebasic.

Once you have rcbasic set up with geany you just need to create a new file and save it as *.bas. Then you can compile your program by going to Build->Compile. Once your program is compiled you can run it by going to Build->Execute.

NOTE: If you want to use a different file extension for rcbasic programs you can still use this file and just set it up for a different extension. Refer to the geany documentation on how to set up different file types.


<b><u>WINDOWS</u></b>
Geany comes preconfigured with rcbasic on windows. Just run the start_editor.bat file and create a new *.bas file. Select the File->New with Template option in the menu to start with a simple template program. Once you have created a new *.bas file goto Build->Compile to compile your program to a *.cbc file. Then goto Build->Execute to run your program.


<h1><b><u>USING RCBASIC FROM THE COMMAND-LINE</u></b></h1>
RCBasic will be added to path on install on linux. On Windows you will need to add the rcbasic folder to your path. Either (rcbasic/rcbasic_32) or (rcbasic/rcbasic_64) depending on your operating system. Once rcbasic is in your path you can simple pass a source file to rcbasic_build to create a *.cbc file.

#code
rcbasic_build myprogram.bas
#/code

Once you have a *.cbc file you can pass it to rcbasic to run it.

#code
rcbasic myprogram.cbc
#/code

Both tools also except the --version argument which will simply output the version of rcbasic you are using.

#code
rcbasic_build --version
rcbasic -version
#/code



<h1><b><u>PORTING TO OTHER PLATFORMS</u></b></h1>

From RCBasic Studio, select tools->distribute and then select the platforms you want to distribute to and click the "MAKE APP" button.
