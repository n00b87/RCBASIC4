#title Update [RCBasic Doc]
#header sub Update()

This is the most important function in a graphics window. It must be called every frame.

It performs a few different operations
#list ol
#li Renders all graphics
#li Checks for every event on the window
	#list ul
	#li Keyboard and Mouse Events
	#li Joystick Events
	#li Window Control Events (minimize, maximize, close, etc.)
	#/list
#li Updates the physics simulation for 2D and 3D objects if enabled
#li Makes breakfast if you are hungry
#/list

If you have a window open, you should have this function being called in your main render loop every frame.
