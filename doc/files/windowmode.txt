#title WindowMode [RCBasic Doc]
#header function WindowMode(visible, fullscreen, resizable, borderless, highDPI)

Returns a bitmask of the combined window flags that can be used in OpenWindow() to set the mode for the window.

Each flag is a boolean that determines whether or not to set that flag in the mask.

Note: For most use cases, one of the following will work

Window
#code
mode = WindowMode(1, 0, 0, 0, 0)
#/code
<br>
Fullscreen
#code
mode = WindowMode(1, 1, 0, 0, 0)
#/code

#ref OpenWindow GetWindowMode
